# OMDB-and-TasteDive-Mashup
Utilize the TasteDive API which lets me provide a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.) as a query input, and returns a set of related items as well as the OMDB API which lets you provide a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review sites (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.) and put those two together. Use TasteDive to get related movies for a whole list of titles and combine the resulting lists of related movies, and sort them according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores.
